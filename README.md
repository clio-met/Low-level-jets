# Low-level-jets
This repository contains the code used to detect low-level jets in rawinsondes and reanalysis/hindcast data.
We use (Norwegian rawinsondes)[https://thredds.met.no/thredds/catalog/remotesensingradiosonde/catalog.html] as well as MET-Norway's NORA3 hindcast ([Haakenstad et al. 2021](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/apme/60/10/JAMC-D-21-0029.1.xml)) and the (CERRA reanalysis)[https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-regional-reanalysis-europe-cerra].
Please see Michel et al. (2025) that investigate low-level jets in Scandinavia.
