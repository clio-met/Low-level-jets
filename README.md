# Low-level-jets

This repository contains the codes used to detect low-level jets in rawinsondes and reanalysis/hindcast data and make figures for the rawinsondes.

We use [Norwegian rawinsondes](https://thredds.met.no/thredds/catalog/remotesensingradiosonde/catalog.html) as well as MET-Norway's NORA3 hindcast ([Haakenstad et al. 2021](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/apme/60/10/JAMC-D-21-0029.1.xml)), the [CERRA reanalysis](https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-regional-reanalysis-europe-cerra), and the [ERA5 reanalysis](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-complete?tab=overview).

Please see Michel et al. (2025) for insights into low-level jets in Scandinavia.
